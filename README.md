### a. Client inputs and requirement
#### Context from client
- Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: client doesn’t want to lose them
- The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
- Currently, client get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
- Client  has done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
- Client would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management

#### Client requirements
Client would like to cover at least following issues: 
- Customers who left within the last month
- Services each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech
support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information: how long as a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges
and number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
